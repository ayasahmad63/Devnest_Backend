node js is a scripting language.

 in nodejs we can apply any javascript program

Modules in Nodjs
  :- var fs=require("fs");

var fs=require("fs");

nodejs have acces and change the folder :-

like to make new folder:-fs.mkdirSync('day_1');

to make file:-fs.writeFileSync("day_1/hello.txt","Hello awsome people",(err)=>{
... if(err){
..... console.log(err);
..... }
... });


Append  in file :-
   fs.appendFileSync("day_1/hello.txt","appended");

read the file:-
    fs.readFileSync("day_1/hello.txt");
        Now you will get the buffer (buffer is for better performance like it break into some code and you will read it line by
 line.)
     
    To read the buffer line we must use "utf-8" it convert it into english :-
      fs.readFileSync("day_1/hello.txt");

rename file:-
   fs.renameSync("day_1/hello.txt","day_1/hello1.txt");

delete folder:-

   we can't delete whole folder directly,firstly we have to delete the file then folder
      To delete file:-
             fs.unlinkSync("day_1/hello1.txt");
           Now to delete folder :-
                  fs.rmdirSync('day_1');      

  ///////This is called repl method  (repl:-read execute print loop //

To work in multiple files:-
